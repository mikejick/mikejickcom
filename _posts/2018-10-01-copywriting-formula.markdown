Do you ever wish that there was an easy formula for writing persuasive (web) copy?

What if you could just follow a few rules to write copy that converts visitors into buyers?

Or just drop a few words into a machine and your seductive copy rolls out at the other side?

Well, at Inbound Rocket we don’t have a robot that automatically generates copy that sells. But we have a formula that will help you write more persuasive copy.

## The AIDA Copywriting Formula

AIDA stands for:

- **Attention:** Grab their attention
- **Interest:** Interest them with interesting facts / uses / stats
- **Desire**: Make them come to the conclusion, “I WANT THIS”
- **Action:** Tell them exactly how to buy, and what will happen next.
